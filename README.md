# Train -Test with sklearn
## IT Academy - Data Science Itinerary: Training set and testing set

*S09-T01: Practicing Training set and testing set with scikit-learn*

A introduction to data pre-procesing and scientific programming with scikit-learn.

as the scikit-learn documentation says: "*Machine learning is about learning some properties of a data set and then testing those properties against another data set. A common practice in machine learning is to evaluate an algorithm by splitting a data set into two. We call one of those sets the **training set**, on which we learn some properties; we call the other set the **testing set**, on which we test the learned properties.*

Here we are going to learn, exercise and understand concepts such as **training set and testing set**, **preprocesing**, **standardize numerical data**, **dummy columns.**

Learning objetives:

+ data preprocessing
+ data transformation
+ dummy Variables
+ Training set and testing set
